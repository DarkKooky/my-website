            Luckily for you, this Quishing attempt is harmless.

        <h1>How to prevent Quishing ?</h1>
        
        <p>
            When scanning a QR code, verify the URL associated with the code and refrain from:
            <ul>
                <li>Submitting personal information</li>
                <li>Making payments</li>
                <li>Downloading files</li>
            </ul>

            Let this be a warning as the next person who leaves a random QR code might have nefarious intentions.
